# Cryptogram
Original Project: https://gitlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/xbb18175/cs207-cryptograms-team-3-2020

This project's purpose was to develop a program in which a user can solve either letter or number cryptograms that are randomly generated using phrases from a text file. The user can choose whether they would like to solve a number or letter cryptogram. The user must be able to save their progress, load their recently saved game, undo any entries that they have made on the cryptogram and also have their score saved on a leaderboard text file. The user can also have access to their stats across games.

This project was completed without the use of external libraries, using only the java libraries provided. 

I was responsible for implementing the randomly generated phrases, using a random number generator that chooses a phrase in an array of Strings read in from a text file. I also coded a loop that will allow the user to guess the full phrase, as well as coding the undo functionality. I also added a 'show solution' option if the user would like to see the solved cryptogram. 

As well as the above contributions, I also helped the group throughout by adding various bug fixes and ensuring that the code was polished and functional before submission.
